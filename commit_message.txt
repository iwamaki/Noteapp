feat: Implement hybrid diffing with inline change detection

This commit introduces a hybrid diffing algorithm that combines line-level and character-level difference detection.
- `diffService.ts`: Implements `calculateLineDiff` for line-based LCS and `convertToInlineChanges` for character-level inline changes. The `generateDiff` function now uses these to provide detailed inline change information for modified lines.
- `DiffViewer.tsx`: Updated to display inline changes with distinct styling for insertions, deletions, and common parts within a line.
- Added new test files for diffService.
