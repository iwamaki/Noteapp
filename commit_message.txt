refactor: Revert detailed logging in platformInfo.ts

Reverted the temporary detailed logging added to `handleAppStateChange` and
`handleColorSchemeChange` in `app/utils/platformInfo.ts`.
The purpose of these logs was to debug system theme detection, which has
now been confirmed to be working correctly after `app.json` configuration
and `expo-system-ui` installation.
